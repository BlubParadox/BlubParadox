I'm Paradox, I used to code sometimes. I still edit photos but videos and music making have become hobbies of the past.

I now spend a lot of my time playing MTG, and working on personal projects, very few of which will ever make it to this page.

This profile will probably only still exist as a reminder of when I used to help in small parts of the FNF Modding Sphere, and to this day i'm still fighting for the right to use a Guitar Hero controller in the game, and not just specific engines.
