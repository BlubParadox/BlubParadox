I'm BlubParadox, I code sometimes. I also edit photos, videos, and dabble a little in music making.

unfortunately, i'm shit at all 3 of those things, but you'll see my work pop up from time to time.

Currently i'm spending most of my time on FNF modding when i'm not at work or playing video games, so look around, snoop through my code, and watch it all go to shit when something updates.
